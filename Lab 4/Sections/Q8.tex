% Compare the measured strain to the theoretical strain. Is the measured strain within 
% the expected value of the theoretical strain?

The nominal value for measured strain is $8.19 \times 10^{-5}$. The theoretical strain is $8.35 \times 10^{-5}$. The percent error is:
\begin{align*}
    \% \text{ Error} &= \frac{8.35 \times 10^{-5} - 8.19 \times 10^{-5}}{8.35 \times 10^{-5}} \times 100\% \\
    &= \boxed{1.85\%}
\end{align*}

The measured strain is close to the theoretical strain. The uncertainty of the measured strain is $5.4 \times 10^{-6}$. The uncertainty of 
the theoretical strain is $1.36 \times 10^{-6}$. The measured strain is not within 1 uncertainty of the theoretical strain. However, it is within 2 uncertainties of 
the theoretical strain, suggesting good agreement.
