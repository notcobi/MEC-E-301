\section{Introduction}

The primary objective of this lab is to investigate and familiarize elements of digital measurements such as 
word length (number of bits), quantization, resolution, conversion rates, sampling, accuracy, and signal conditioning. The Arduino Uno 
will be used to measure a voltage source which will undergo signal conditioning and be converted to a digital signal. Understanding precise digital
measurements is important for the design of control systems, data acquisition, and signal processing.
