% FLOW VELOCITY AND FLOW RATE
% You are to evaluate methods of velocity and flow rate measurement with the aim of 
% understanding the characteristics of each device, limitations, and sources of error.
% 1. MEASUREMENT OF AIR VELOCITY - PROCEDURE
% Measurement of flow velocity can be carried out by using many different instruments. In 
% this section of the lab you will investigate the velocity profile of a duct, the effect of 
% probe alignment and then use one flow velocity measurement device to calibrate a 
% second.
% 1.1. EQUIPMENT - Air Velocity Measurement
% The following equipment will be used to measure air velocity:
% • Calibration air jet consisting of an electrically driven centrifugal fan with 
% adjustable inlet damper. The discharge passes through flow straightening tubes in 
% a round pipe, and forms a variable velocity air jet at the pipe exit.
% • Pitot-static tube connected to serve as both stagnation and Pitot-static probes
% • Inclined manometers for stagnation and Pitot-static pressures.
% • Constant temperature hot wire anemometer
% • Metal ruler
% • Mercury barometer
% • Thermometer
% 1.2. Procedure - Measurement of Duct Velocity Profile by Pitot Tube
% Pitot Tube Setup
% A Pitot tube is a device that can measure the local static pressure as well as the stagnation 
% pressure. A schematic of a Pitot tube is shown in Figure 1. The stagnation pressure is the 
% sum of the local pressure as well as the pressure induced by the flow when the fluid is 
% brought to a stop at the end of the tip of the probe. This pressure is a sum of the static 
% and dynamic pressure.
% With the air jet fan off, centre the Pitot static probe by eye in the pipe and align it with 
% the flow direction. Adjust the probe tip so that it is about 10 mm from the pipe exit.
% Adjust the probe so it is aligned with the flow and the protractor is centered at 90°. Move 
% the hot wire anemometer probe out of the flow by sliding it up in the holder. Set the 
% bubble levels on the inclined manometers for proper instrument alignment and adjust the 
% scales to read zero. 
% Measurement of Duct Velocity Profile
% Turn on the fan and adjust the inlet damper plate to produce about an 80% of full scale 
% displacement on the inclined manometers. Using the Pitot-static probe, measure the 
% MecE 301 2
% velocity profile across the duct outlet. You should take at least ten points across the duct 
% to obtain a reasonable representation. Record the data in Table 2.
% Figure 1. A schematic of a Pitot-static tube.
% Effect of Yaw Angle
% The alignment of the Pitot to the flow direction can influence the accuracy of the velocity 
% measurement. This angle, illustrated in Figure 2 is known as the yaw angle of the probe. 
% This section of the lab will investigate the effect of yaw angle on the accuracy of the 
% velocity measurement.
% Adjust the probe so that the tip of the probe is located on the axis of rotation. Measure the 
% effect of yaw angle on both the stagnation and Pitot-static pressures by rotating the probe 
% in its holder. Take at least 5 readings on each side of the correct alignment and record the 
% data in Table 3. 
% Figure 2. The yaw angle of a Pitot tube
% 1.3. Procedure - Calibration of Hot Wire Anemometer
% Calibrate the hot wire anemometer using the Pitot tube as a velocity standard. As 
% previously noted, the velocity profile across the outlet of the discharge pipe is not 
% uniform. Since the two devices cannot be placed in exactly the same location at the same 
% time, the spacing between the probes must be determined. With the fan off, lower the hot 
% wire anemometer probe until the anemometer element is at the same height as the Pitotstatic probe tip. Determine the spacing distance between the hot wire element and the tip 
% of the Pitot static tube using the steel ruler. Zero the anemometer. Turn on the fan and 
% calibrate the anemometer at 10 different flow velocities at the centreline by adjusting the 
% air dampener and record the data in Table 4. The anemometer output voltage may 
% saturate at high velocities (i.e. the voltage will not change with the velocity), so make 
% sure your measurements are below the maximum range of the instrument. At each 
% MecE 301 3
% velocity you will take a reading using the Pitot tube and then move the anemometer to the 
% same point and read the output. 
% Measure the air jet temperature with a thermometer. Read the mercury barometer, 
% applying the appropriate temperature and gravity corrections from the tables provided 
% and record the data in Table 5. 
% 2. AIR FLOW RATE MEASUREMENT - PROCEDURE
% 2.1. EQUIPMENT - Air Flow Rate Measurement
% Air flow rate calibration system consisting of several flow rate meters placed in series 
% along a pipe supplied with compressed air from the building supply. The flow meters and 
% their output devices are:
% • Glass tube rotameter
% • ASME nozzle with 36" U-tube alcohol manometer
% • ASME orifice plate with 60" U-tube alcohol manometer
% • Turbine meter with pulse output and frequency counter
% • Venturi meter with 200 mm H2O Magnehelic gauge and 240 mm water combined 
% inclined/vertical manometer connected in parallel
% • Thermometer
% • D.C. power supply for turbine meter
% 2.2. PROCEDURE - Air Flow Rate Measurement
% Initial system analysis
% Record in Table 6 the internal diameters of the three obstruction meters. Check the zero 
% on the Magnehelic dial gauge and the level bubble and zero setting of the inclinedvertical manometers. Turn on the compressed air supply valve and set the maximum 
% flow rate to 90 or 95% as indicated on the rotameter. The reading from the rotameter is 
% used here only as an indication of the flow rate. The maximum flow rate is limited by the 
% range of the inclined manometers and excess flow will cause the manometers to 
% overflow.
% Divide the available range into ten approximately equal increments, as measured using 
% the rotameter. Measure the output of the six different meters at each of these flow 
% settings, in decreasing order of flow rates and record data in Table 7. Readings should be 
% made simultaneously to allow accurate comparison of the meters. 
% MecE 301 4
% Analysis of calibration data
% For the air flow rate calibration system, assume that the orifice plate is the standard 
% giving the true flow rate within the pipe. 
% Compute the "true" flow rate as measured by the orifice flow meter at each flow rate 
% using Table 1. Recall that the flow rate, Q, of an incompressible fluid through an 
% obstruction meter is:
% (3)
% where A2 is the area of the obstruction, DP is the pressure difference of the obstruction, 
% and r is the density of the fluid. The flow coefficient, K, is;
% (4)
% where C is the discharge coefficient (see below) and b is the ratio of nozzle diameter to 
% pipe diameter.
% Use these computed flow rates to determine the venturi and nozzle discharge coefficients, 
% Cv and Cn. The accepted value (with an uncertainty of 2%) for the nozzle discharge 
% coefficient, Cn, is,
% , for 0.2 ≤ b ≤ 0.8 and 104 ≤ ReD ≤ 107 (5)
% and (6)
% where V is the average velocity of the fluid, µ is the dynamic viscosity, and D is the inner 
% diameter of the pipe.
% The accepted discharge coefficient for a machined venturi is Cv = 0.995 +/- 1% for 
% 50 mm D 250 mm; 0.4 b 0.75; 2x105 ReD 1x106 (ISO standard: 5167-
% 4:2003). Outside the recommend ranges of operation the discharge coefficient may differ 
% by a few percent. 
% The pressure drop in a perfect laminar flow element is linearly proportional to flow rate, 
% Q. Since a real device causes some flow blockage, an additional pressure loss (equivalent 
% to a sudden expansion in a pipe) will add a drop proportional to Q2
% . The expected form 
% of the calibration equation is,
% ΔP = AQ + BQ2 (7)
% where A and B are constants. 
% Fully developed flow is required to ensure accurate measurement with obstruction flow 
% meters. Fully developed flow is typically obtained by using adequate lengths of straight 
% pipe before and after the flow element. Figure 3 shows the recommended minimum 
% lengths of pipe preceding and following orifices, flow nozzles and venturi tubes. The

Given that the gas constant for air is $R = \qty{0.287}{\kilo\joule\per\kilogram\per\kelvin}$, the density of air is
\begin{align*}
    PV &= mRT \\
    \implies \rho &= \frac{P}{RT} \\
    &= \frac{708.9/7.501}{0.287 \times (22 + 273.15)} \\
    &= \boxed{\qty{1.18}{\kilogram\per\meter\cubed}}
\end{align*}

% question 2
\section{}
The maximum velocity is given by
\begin{equation}
    v = \frac{2 P_v}{\rho} \label{eq:velocity from dynamic pressure}
\end{equation}
where $P_v$ is the dynamic pressure and $\rho$ is the density of air. The maximum pressure from 
Table 2 is $P_v = \qty{20.5}{\mmwater}$. From hydrostatic pressure,
\begin{equation*}
    P = h \rho_w g = \qty{1}{\milli\meter} \times \qty{997}{\kilogram\per\meter\cubed} \times \qty{9.81}{\meter\per\second\squared} = \qty{9.78}{\pascal} = \qty{1}{\mmwater}
\end{equation*}
where $\rho_w$ is the density of water \cite{bigg_density_1967}. Thus in (\ref{eq:velocity from dynamic pressure}),
\begin{align*}
    v = \frac{2 \times 20.5 \times 9.78}{1.18} = \boxed{\qty{19.0}{\meter\per\second}}
\end{align*}

% question 3
\section{}
Similarly, the velocity at a yaw angle of $-45^\circ$ is given by (\ref{eq:velocity from dynamic pressure}) with 
$P_v = \qty{14.5}{\mmwater}$. The velocity is
\begin{align*}
    v = \frac{2 \times 14.5 \times 9.78}{1.18} = \boxed{\qty{13.6}{\meter\per\second}}
\end{align*}
The error is
\begin{align*}
    \% err = \frac{19.0 - 13.6}{19.0} \times 100\% = \boxed{28.4\%}

For the venturi meter, $\delta C_d/|C_d| = 0.02$, $\delta P_v/|P_v| = 0.01$, and $\delta \rho/|\rho| = 0.0141$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\delta Q}{|Q|} &= \sqrt{\left(0.02\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\times 0.01\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\times 0.0141\right)^2} \\
    &= \pm 0.02
\end{align*}
For the nozzle meter, $\delta C_d/|C_d| = 0.01$, $\delta P_v/|P_v| = 0.01$, and $\delta \rho/|\rho| = 0.0141$. Thus,
\begin{align*}
    \frac{\delta Q}{|Q|} &= \sqrt{\left(0.01\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\times 0.01\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{2}\times 0.0141\right)^2} \\
    &= \pm 0.02
\end{align*}

For the orifice meter, the $\rho$ term is the dominant term as
\begin{equation*}
    %\left(\frac{1}{2}\times \delta P_v/|P_v|\right)^2 > \left(\frac{1}{2}\times \delta \rho/|\rho|\right)^2 > \left(\delta C_d/|C_d|\right)^2
    \left(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{\delta \rho}{|\rho|}\right)^2 > \left(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac{\delta P_v}{|P_v|}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\delta C_d}{|C_d|}\right)^2
\end{equation*}
The venturi and nozzle meter, the dominant term is $C_d$ as 
\begin{equation*}
    \left(\frac{\delta C_d}{|C_d|}\right)^2 > \left(\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{\delta \rho}{|\rho|}\right)^2 > \left(\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{\delta P_v}{|P_v|}\right)^2
\end{equation*}

From the linear regression $y = ax + b$ in Figure \ref{fig:turbine_meter_calibration}, the sensitivity is
\begin{equation*}
    \boxed{sensitivity = \qty{1.7E4}{\hertz\per\meter\cubed\per\second}}
